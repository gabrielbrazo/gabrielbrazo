# Hi there 👋🏾

I am a undergraduate student in Agricultural and Environmental Engineering at the Federal Fluminense University.
Since 2020 I've working with geoprocessing using QGIs, and in 2021 I took a step forward by adopting my activities to the python environment.
As a result, I have been working with geospatial data in addition to working with a focus in geoprocessing and global climate change.🌎
